In this project we were given the following instructions : 

Chada Tech has domestic and international clients. To meet international standard ISO 8601, 
Chada Tech wants their clients to be able to view a 12- and a 24-hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock.
To stand out as a top candidate, you will need to apply program logic by creating two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input using secure and efficient C++ code.

In this project I felt I did particularly well in building out the logic beforehand. At this point in the class we hadn't quite got learning this pointers in C++,
but from my experience in Java I was able to do a little googling and figure out how to make it work here. Manging the nested if and switch statements was the
next most challenging thing. However I took it slow and debugged along the way until I found the right order of logic. This assignment was a fun practice since
it didn't require a lot of methods but still a fair amount to have to really slow down and think.

In all honesty I feel like I did a perfect job here as per the assignment requirements. As I'm reviewing the code I feel very proud of the work I did here and 
overall in the class. This assignment in particular was a big milestone for me to pull in a great deal of programming principles into one simple interface and get
a bird's eye view on how all these pieces work together. After making sure my clocks worked according to the instructions I went back in and made sure my comments
were in the right places and made sense to the flow of the program as well as formatted everything in order to make it easily readable.
